For 16 months, the smiling faces of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons,
Ariel and Kfir, had been slowl
y receding into the background of Isr
aeli life as their photographs — post
ed on walls and bus stops soon after the family’s abduction to Ga
za in October 2023 — began to fade, tear and
 peel.
On F
riday, the Bib
as’s lives and disturbi
ng deaths were swept back to the
 forefront of Israel’s collective conscio
 usness in such a startling and unsettling way
 that it set off fresh alarm about the fate of the fra
 gile cease-fire in Gaza.
Early
on Friday morning, the Israeli military announced that the body of Ms. Bibas — nominally returned, along with those of her sons, by Hamas to Israel on Thursday — appeared to be that of someone else. And an autopsy of the two boys, aged 4 and 8 months at the time of their abduction, revealed that they were killed by terrorists in Gaza, the military said.
